NOTES—BOOK Vl

417. tegna: accusative with personat. Cf. l. 17¹.

418. adverso: opposite to them as they land.

4²0· Melle soporatam - offam: ‘a cake made stupefying with honey and
drugged meal’ Soporatom cannot strictly apply to melle, and must be re·
garded here as joined with it by a kind of zeugma In strictness the language
would be melle imbutam et frugibus niedr'catr's soporatam.

421. fame: H. 145, 3; Α. 59, 2, b; G. 68, 83 (H. 137, 2).

424. Occupat: ⁶ gains'; seizing the time before the dog shall recover from
the opiate. sepulto: i.e. in sonoro. Cf. ΙΙ, 265.

425. Evaditque ripam: ‘escaping from the banlr.5 Evadr't is used with
reference to the threatened hindrance interposed by the watchdog. The
verb with -que appended, as frequently, may be rendered by a participle.

426-439. Aeneas first comes to the abode of those who have died in infancy,
and of those who have been put to death under false accusations, or who have
been impelled hythe hardships of life to commit suicide.

427. in limine primo: ‘at the very threshold.’ Having passed hythe
cave where the watchdog lies, he now enters by a gateway the dwelling place
of the shades.

430. mortis: for the case, see note on voti, V, 237.

431· Neo sine sorte, etc: the customs of the Romans are here alluded
to. The description is purposely vagae, since herc, as in other passages of
description, the poet is not bound to definiteness of detail, but such descrip-
tions everywhere must be judged rather from artistic consideratione. Minos
as quaesitor, praetor, or presiding officer of the court, assigns judges, or jnrors
(iudices), to decide on the case of each individual. These jurors he appoints
by drawing lots from an urn (movet urnam). Conington supposes sedes to
refer to the abodes of the shades in general, and not alone to those of the class
just mentioned.

432, 433. ille-discit: ‘he both summons the assembly of the silent

(shades) and investigates their lives and their transgressions’; i.e. it is his
prerogative to summon them before the court, and to investigate and decide

each case according to the method of procedure above explained.
436. aethere in alto: see note on l. 128.

440-476. Aeneas next arrives at the fields of mourning (lugentes corripi),
where dwell the shades of such as have in any way come toan untimely end
on account of love. Here he meets Dido, and in vain tries to obtain her for·

giveness.

440. partem fusi iu omnem: ‘extending in every direction'
442. quos: the masculine, because both sexes are included.
