362-484. The pugilistic contest is next described. Dares, a Trojan, pre-
sents himself as the challenges, but at first no one is disposed to compete with
him. Then an old Sicilian ol Trojan descent, Entellus, is induced by his
friend Acestes to enter the lists. They put on the gauntlets furnished by
Aeneas, and begin the fight. Entellus at first stands on the delensive, and
merely patries or avoids the blows of his more nimble antagonist. At last
the old man aims a blow with immense ellort at Dares, who adroitly turns
aside, leaving Entellus to fall headlong by the impetus ol his own motion.
Entellus, thus roused by shame and revenge, rises from the ground, attacks
Dares with fury, and gains the victory.

which!

373. veniens se ferebat, etc: ‘who boasted ol his descent from,' etc.
As in II, 377, ΙΙΙ, 310, the participle agrees with the subiect, yet virtually
modifies the predicate as is in the accusative. Others render, ‘who with
huge bulk 'strode forth (se ferebat) adescendant os‚' etc. Amyci: Amycus,
king of the Bebrycians, compelled all strangers to contend with him until
at length he was killed by Pollux, who had landed with the other Argonrtute
in Bithynia. ·

375. prima in proelia: ‘lor the beginning os the fight‘3 or p
