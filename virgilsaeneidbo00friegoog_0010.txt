PREFACE

ΙΝ this edition of the Aeneid the revising editor has attempted
to make only such alterations and additions as Dr. Frieze would
have himself made. The Introduction has been enlarged by the
addition of sections on the plan of the Aeneid, the meter, manu-
scripts, editions, and helpful books of reference. The English
form of the poet's name is changed to Virgil, in accordance with
the practice of leading scholars on both sides of the Atlantic.

Changes have been made in the text only where readings, for·
merly disputed, have now become established. In> accordwith
the spelling of words iu inscriptions of the first century an, the
forms vulnus, vulgus, vult, Vulcanus,¹ etc, are preferred to volnus,
vagus, etc. To meet the need of early assistance in reading hex-
ameter verse metrically‚ the long vowels in the first two books are
indicated. Tlre markings sanctioned by Lewis’s Elementary
Latin Dictionary, and by the Appendix to Bennett’s Latin
Grammar, where these are in disagreement‚ have been followed,
although the editor is aware that some hidden quantities are still
in dispute‚ e.g. vowels before gn, cius, lzm‘us, cuius, nraxz'mus,
and some others.

The Notes have been thoroughly revised. Old grammar refer-
ences have been corrected, and new ones (to Lane and Morgan's ’
and Bennett's grammars) added. But few of the old illustra-
tions are retained.

Acknowledgment is made of the free use of all critical and
annotated editions of the poet, especially of those of Page (1894—

1 See the Classical Review‚ 1899, pp. 116 and 156. ln words involving assimila-
tion also (summoveo, summitto, etc.) 1 have followed the results published in
this periodical.
