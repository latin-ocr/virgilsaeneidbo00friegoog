NOTES

BOOK I

Ille ego, qui quondam gracili niodulatus avena
Carmen, el egressus silvis, vicina coigr'
Ut quamvis avido parerent arua colono,
Gratum opus agricolis .· at nunc horrentia Martis.

THE above verses are usually placed, in the editions of Virgil, at the begin·
ning os the Aeneid, but printed in a form different srom that ol the text, as an
indication that there is a question as to their authenticity‚ and as to their
proper connection with the poem. They were known to Servius, the great
commentator on Virgil‚ and seem not unworthy os the poet. But, on the
other hand, the lines are not found in the best manuscripts, while “all
antiquity‚” as Ribbeck says, “recognizes the words arma virumque as the
beginning of the poem.'’ They were thus understood by Propertius and
quoted by Ovid, contemporaries practically of the poet, and by the later
writers, Martial and Persius. lt is possible that these lour lines were prefixed
by the poet to one or more copies os the first book presented to personal
friends. At any rate, although they may be Virgilian, they should not sorni
part ol the text.

Trans: ⁴1, that poet who formerly tuned my song with the slender pipe,
and (then) coming forth from the wood (ie. dismissing sylvan or pastoral
themes) taught the neighboring fields to sullill the desire of the husbandmen,
however greedy (ie. made his labors lruitsul through the teachings of my
poems on husbandry), a work (of song) acceptable to the tillers ol the soil:
yet now sing the bristling arms of Mars.’

ego: sc. cana.
’ vicina: ‘neighboring’ near by the woods, implying that the subjects of the
Bucolics and Georgics are nearly related.

horrentia: the idea of ‘terrible' or ‘dreadsul’ is occasionally associated, as
perhaps here, with the literal meaning of horrens.
