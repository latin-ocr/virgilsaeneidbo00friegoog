N2 VIRGlL’S AENEID

The storm at sea, the landing of Aeneas near Carthage, and his
reception at the palace of Dido.

1-7. The exordium: “ Arms l sing, and the man, driven by fate from his
native Ilium: who endured many hardships of land and sea and war, until
he founded in Latium the kingdom from which sprang mighty Rome.'’
Thus are indicated briefly the contents of the entire poem: Aeneas, obedi·
ent to the fates and to the godS, in his wanderings, his trials, and his war of
conquest. ln ocultum et terris iactatus et alto, we have the subject of the
first six books of the epic, which thns far resembles the Odyssey; in multa
quoque et bello passus that of the last six books, in which the poet describes
warlike scenes like those of the iliad.

1. qui: relatives and other connectives are 'often displaced in poetry, and
sometimes very widely, from their regular position. primus: ‘first,’ in the
usual sense of ‘the first wh0.' There is no inconsistency between this state-
ment and that made in l. 2212 in regard to Antenor, for Patavium, which this
T rojan hero founded, being in Cisalpine Gaul, was not regarded by Virgil as
strictly within the limits of Italy. ·

2. Italiam: for ad Italiam. ln poetry the omission of prepositions is
frequent before accusatives and ablatives of place; the cases being sufficient
to express, without prepositions, the relations of ‘to,’ ‘from,' and ⁴in.’ fato
profugus: ‘exiled by late '; ‘by late a wanderer.’ Thus is presented at the
very beginning the idea of the supremacy of fate, which gives unity to the
Aeneid. Lavina: for the regular form, Lavim'a. Lavino litora is added
to ltaliam to restrict the meaning. Cf. l. 569.

3. ille: in apposition with qui, recalls and emphasizes the subJ'ect. iacta·
fus, passus: to be taken as participles.

4. superum: for supermeat, ‘the gods above '3 equivalent here to divina,
agreeing with vi, and referring especially to Jnno; for she alone of the
Olympian gods was persecuting Aeneas. saevae: in poetry, adjectives and
genitives are commonly separated from the substantives to which they belong.
memorem: ‘relentless'; that forgets not.

5. quoque: join with mulla. et: connects the foregoing et terris et alto with
bello ,¹ ‘in war also (as well as on land and sea) having suffered much besides’
dum conderet: ‘while he was striving to found '3 expressing an idea of purpose.
