these, the lowest five strata are prehistoric, the second stratum dating, it is esti· ·'
mated, from about 3000 nc. The sixth stratum is the most important and tbe y

most interesting, since this is theone that actually represents the Pergamos of

Homer and the ancient Troia of Virgil. Remains of seven large buildings were Ι

discovered, of a construction that resembles that of the ancient sites of Tiryns and
of Mycenae¹ the home of Agamemnon. Upon the acropolis were found remains
of an ancient temple, surrounded by a wall of fortification, having a strong tower at
the northeast angle. Traces of fire were also discovered.

BOOK III

The voyages and settlements of Aeneas before his arrival at
Carthage.

Tite time embraced in the narrative of this book is nearly seven years. It
begins with the events immediately succeeding the fall of Troy, which oc·
curred traditionally in 1184 tac. The Trojan fugitives, under the command
of Aeneas, spent the remainder of the summer, and the following winter, in
building ships in the harhor of Antandros (snb Antandro), a city on the
southern side of hlount Ida. This was the first year, i.e. the first summer
and winter, after the fall of Troy. The second year begins with the depar-
ture of the exiles (early in the summer) for Thrace, and is spent in the
attempt to establish aeolony there (ll. 13-69). In the third year the new
colony, called Aenos or, as some think, Aenea, is abandoned, and the wan-
derers, stopping at Delos to consult the oracl (l. 73), proceed to Crete (l.
131), and commence the colony of Pergameum (ll. 132-134). Haviug
passed the fourth year and part of the fifth in Crete, they are compelled bya
pestilence to give up this settlement also (l. 190), and sail to Actium in
Acarnania, where they rernain during the 'fifth winter (l. 284). They resume
their voyage in the beginning of the sixth summer, and first landing near
Buthrotum, and meeting with llelenus and Andromache (ll. 294-505), they
cross the Adriatic to Portus Veneris, in Apulia (l. 523), and from thence con·
tinue their voyage along the coasts of Italy and Sicily to Drepanum (l. 707),
which they reach at the close of the sixth snmrner, and where soon atter-
wards Anchises dies (l. 710). In the beginning of the following, or seventh
summer (see l, 34sqq.), they start for Italy, but are immediately driven bl ³
sternito the coast of Africa.

1-68. Aeneas, with twenty ships, built in Antandros, passes over to Thrace
and attempts his first settlement of Aenea, or Aenos. After commencing ΜΒ
colony, he is warned by the shade of the munlered Polydorus to flee frOm
Thrace, and again sets sail with his followers.
