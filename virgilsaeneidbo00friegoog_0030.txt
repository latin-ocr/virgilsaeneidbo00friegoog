Rhythm in English verse depends upon the strong word stress
which prevails in this language3 it results from the collocation of
words in such a manner as to produce a regularly recurring
necent. In the Latin language, on the other hand, the accent of
the individual word was very slight. In poetry, therefore, there
was another basis for metrical rhythm‚ namely, the regular recur-
rence of long and short syllables.1 In this respect, both in prose
and poetry, Latin differs radically from English, namely‚ in its
practice of giving more time (theoretically twice as much) to the
pronunciation of certain vowels tha'n it does to others. The
English language is accentual, the Latin is quantitative.

Since the quantitative character is as truly present in prose'as
in poetry, it follows that if one read Latin poetry as he should
read Latin prose, that is, with a proper observance, in his pro·
nuntiation, of long and short syllables? the metrical flow would
beapparent without any further effort on the part of the reader.
nur since our own language has an entirely different basis for its
verse, it is at first difficult to read Latin poetry quantitatively.
Only abundant practice will nralre it easy and enjoyable.

Very often a laclr of perfect familiarity with the length of root
vowels is a hindrance to the reader. The student should first of
all know fairly well the quantity of final syllables. He will get
information on this in his grammars (H. 691 fol, LM. 1096 fol.;

lCompare in this connection Bennett, The Quantitative Reading of Latin
Poetry,Boston‚1899; What was lctus in Latin Prosody? American Journal of
Pttlology, vol. XIX, pp. 361t01.; and Hale, The Roman Pronunciation of Latin,
b Sclool Review, 1898, pp. 394 fol.

2ΡιιρίΙε should carefully distinguish between a long vowel and a long syllable.
Along syllable may be one (1) which contains a long vowel followed by a single
wnsonant or (2) which contains a long vowel followed by two or more conso·
nanu, or (3) even one which contains a short vowel if followed by two or more
consonauts. Thus limpore is just as much a dactyl as stamine.
