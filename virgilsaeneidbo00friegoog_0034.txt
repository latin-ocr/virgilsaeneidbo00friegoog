Schcdac Rescriptac Veronenscs, the l'eroua palimpsest. Slightly

inferior is' the Codex Mcdr'ccus, preserved in the laurentian Library
oi Florence. From asubscn'ptio, or note appended to the Eclogues,
ve leam that this manuscript cannot be later than nn. 494. Oi
less importance still is the Codex Romanus. Of the seven lead-
ing manuseriptS, the two remaining are so incomplete that they
have little value in determining the text of the poems. They are
the Schcdae Rescnptac Sangallcnscs, another palimpsest which has
but ten leaves preserved, and the Sclzcdac Bcrolr'crcnscs or Putcaccac,
which has but seven leaves containing each sorty lines 'l‘he later

the readings os the older capital manuscripts. Ribbeck derives
all existing manuscripts of Virgil srom oue common original called
an ‘archetypus’ written with but little regard for calligraphy in the
cursive style, and filled with numerous conjectures, glosses‚ and
interpolations.

No Latin author was quoted more extensively than Virgil by
ancient scholars and grammarians. Nearly every line may be
lound somewhere in the works of later Roman writers, cited word

the text as we receive it in the manuscripts, sor in such citations
the memory was relied upon largely, and no need was felt of con·
firming the reading by reference to a reliable manuscript. We

schools als0. An interesting confirmation os this are the scratch-
ings upon the walls of ancient Pompeii os the opening lines os both
the first and second books, Arum cu'rrcmqrcc cano and Conticuere
