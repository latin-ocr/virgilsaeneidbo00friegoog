462. bubo: feminine only in Virgil. lt was a bird of ill omen, and when·
ever it appeared in Rome an expiatory sacrifice was made. culminibus:
‘on the (palace) roofs.' Tennyson is indebted to Virgil, in Lancelot aud

469-473. Her mind is filled with diseased fancies; she is like Pentheus
who was driven mad by thc Furies (the Eumenides, or Dirae) because hc
opposed the introduction of the Bacchanalian rites into his kingdom ol
T hebes; or, like Orestes, also represented on the stage (scaenis) as pursued
(agitatus) by the Furies. ln the Bacchae of Euripides l. 918, which Virgil
may have in mind, Pentheus says, ‘I seem to see two suns, and Thebes, aud
the seven-gated city doublc.’ ln the Eumenides of Aeschylus, Orestes, fleeing
from the avenging shade of Clytemestra, and from the Furies (cf. Ill, 331),
seeks refuge in the temple of Apollo at Delphi. The Furies follow to the
door of the sanctuary‚ which they are afraid to invade', an'd therefore sit,
guarding the entrance (sedent in lr‘mine Dirae).

to be erected in the court of the palace, ostensibly for the purpose of burning
an image of Aeneas, and the arms and clothing left by him3 which ceremony,
she assures Anna, will magically work the cure of her love for Aeneas, or else
restore him to her affections. A sorceress from the Hesperides has given her
instructions to perform the ceremony, with the promise of such a result; and

Dido causes Anna to believe that she intends nothing more than to go
through with these magic rites. ln the night, when by herself, she gives
utterance to her bitter anguish.

475. secum: ‘with herself (alone)’; without the knowledge of Anna, or
any confidant. modum: the mode of accomplisbing her death.
